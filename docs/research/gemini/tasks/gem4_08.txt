Task 3.3: Transitive Dependency Propagation
* Context: Manual listing of recursive dependencies.1
* Issue: Broken encapsulation and verbose config.
* Fix Prompt:"Modify DependencyGraph::resolve_flags(). When processing depends_on, perform a recursive collection of the dependency's dependencies. Aggregate their public include paths and link flags. Deduplicate the list. Apply the aggregated flags to the current target's compilation context automatically."
