4. Quality Assurance: Testing Subsystem
Gap: test target type exists but has no execution logic.1
Dependency: Required for verifying language correctness.
* Step 5: Implement TestRunner and Execution Logic.
   * Prompt: "Act as a QA Automation Engineer. Implement the TestRunner class for AriaBuild. This class should accept a list of compiled test targets (paths to .ll files). For each target, it must invoke the LLVM interpreter lli using the Process class created in Step 1. It needs to implement logic to: 1. Run the test binary. 2. Capture the exit code (0 for success, non-zero for failure). 3. Capture standard output to detect test assertion failures. 4. Print a summary report (e.g., '5 Tests Passed, 1 Failed'). Handle parallel test execution using std::future or a thread pool."
