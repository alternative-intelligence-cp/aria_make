3. Toolchain Orchestration: FFI and Linking
Gap: ToolchainOrchestrator lacks logic for -l and -L flags implied by extern.1
Dependency: Required for integrating C libraries.
* Step 4: Enhance ToolchainOrchestrator for Library Linking.
   * Prompt: "Act as a Build System Architect. Enhance the ToolchainOrchestrator::construct_compile_cmd C++ method. Add logic to handle Foreign Function Interface (FFI) requirements. Specifically, allow the Target struct to contain a libraries list (e.g., ['m', 'pthread']) and a library_paths list. Update the command construction logic to append the appropriate -l and -L flags to the ariac or linker invocation. Additionally, implement platform detection to adjust flags for Linux (.so, -l) vs Windows (.dll, .lib)."
