FFI Linking Architecture Enhancement for aria_make

PRIORITY: HIGH
STATUS: Partially Covered
SOURCE: gem4_04.txt, Verification Chunks 4-5

PROBLEM:
The ToolchainOrchestrator lacks comprehensive Foreign Function Interface (FFI) support for linking external C/C++ libraries. Required for libcurl integration (package manager dependency).

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Extend Target schema with:
   - libraries: vector<string> (e.g., ["curl", "ssl", "pthread"])
   - library_paths: vector<string> (e.g., ["/usr/local/lib"])

2. Platform-specific flag generation:
   - Linux: -L/path -lcurl
   - Windows: /LIBPATH:path curl.lib

3. Transitive library propagation:
   - If App depends on LibA, and LibA depends on libcurl, App must automatically receive -lcurl

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS:
- [ ] Update src/build/target.h struct with libraries and library_paths fields
- [ ] Update ABC parser to read new fields from aria.json
- [ ] Implement platform detection (Linux/Windows/macOS)
- [ ] Create construct_link_cmd() separate from construct_compile_cmd()
- [ ] Add ELF vs PE/COFF linking logic
- [ ] Implement recursive library collection from dependency graph
- [ ] Add library ordering logic (reverse topological for static linking)

FILES TO MODIFY:
- include/build/target.h
- src/build/toolchain.cpp (ToolchainOrchestrator)
- src/parse/abc_parser.cpp
- docs/info/plan/40_EXECUTION_ENGINE.md (add FFI section)

RESEARCH REFERENCE:
gem4_04.txt provides complete architectural specification including:
- Symbol resolution mechanics
- CRT initialization requirements
- Import library handling (Windows)
- -rpath for runtime library discovery

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Can link against libcurl for HTTP requests
- Can link against libm for math functions
- Can link against libpthread for threading
- Works on Linux and Windows without manual flag injection
- Transitive libraries propagate automatically
