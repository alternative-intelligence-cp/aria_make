Cross-Platform FileWatcher for Incremental Builds

PRIORITY: LOW (Nice-to-Have)
STATUS: Not in Plan
SOURCE: gem3_08.txt, Verification Chunk 4

PROBLEM:
Developers must manually re-run aria_make after file changes. No continuous build mode like cargo watch or tsc --watch.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Watch mode CLI:
   - aria_make --watch (monitor entire project)
   - aria_make --watch <target> (monitor specific target)

2. Platform-specific event systems:
   - Linux: inotify API
   - macOS: FSEvents framework
   - Windows: ReadDirectoryChangesW

3. Event handling:
   - Debouncing (ignore rapid-fire saves)
   - Recursive directory monitoring
   - Filter events (only .aria, .json files)
   - Trigger incremental rebuild on changes

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS:
- [ ] Create FileWatcher abstraction class
- [ ] Implement Linux inotify backend
- [ ] Implement macOS FSEvents backend
- [ ] Implement Windows ReadDirectoryChangesW backend
- [ ] Add debouncing logic (300-500ms window)
- [ ] Integrate with BuildScheduler for triggered builds
- [ ] Implement event filtering (.aria, aria.json only)
- [ ] Add dedicated watcher thread (non-blocking)
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C handling)

FILES TO CREATE:
- src/watch/file_watcher.h (platform abstraction)
- src/watch/inotify_watcher.cpp (Linux)
- src/watch/fsevents_watcher.cpp (macOS)
- src/watch/win_watcher.cpp (Windows)
- src/cli/watch_command.cpp (CLI integration)

RESEARCH REFERENCE:
gem3_08.txt provides:
- Complete platform API comparison
- Event debouncing algorithm
- Thread safety considerations
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown

DEFERRED RATIONALE:
Not critical for MVP. Developers can use external tools (entr, watchexec) or IDE integration. Adds significant platform-specific complexity.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (if implemented):
- aria_make --watch rebuilds on .aria file save
- Debounces rapid saves (save 10 times = 1 rebuild)
- Works on Linux, macOS, Windows
- Low CPU overhead (<1% when idle)
- Graceful exit with Ctrl+C
