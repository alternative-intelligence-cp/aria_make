2. Dependency Management: Module Resolution
Gap: The mod and use keywords are reserved but have no resolution logic in the build system.1
Dependency: Required for multi-file project compilation.
* Step 2: Implement Module Resolution Algorithm.
   * Prompt: "Act as a Language Architect. Define the official Module Resolution Strategy for Aria and implement the ModuleResolver::resolve(string module_name) C++ method. The strategy should follow Rust-like conventions: 1. Look for module_name.aria. 2. Look for module_name/mod.aria. 3. Respect a configured source_path in aria.json. Implement the method to return the absolute path of the module source file or throw an error if not found."
