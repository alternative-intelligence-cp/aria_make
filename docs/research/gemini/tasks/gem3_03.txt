* Step 3: Create DependencyScanner Class.
   * Prompt: "Act as a Compiler Engineer. Design and implement a lightweight C++ DependencyScanner class for the Aria build tool. This class should accept a file path, read the Aria source code, and extract all module imports defined by the use keyword (e.g., use std.io;). It should resolve these import paths relative to a project root using the ModuleResolver from Step 2 and return a list of std::filesystem::path dependencies. Optimization goal: Do not construct a full AST; use a fast lexical scan or regex approach to identify the imports quickly. Handle comments (// and /* */) to avoid false positives."
