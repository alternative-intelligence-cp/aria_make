7. Developer Experience: Watch Mode
Gap: AriaBuild lacks the responsiveness of the Language Server.
Dependency: Required for modern DX.
* Step 8: Implement FileWatcher for Incremental Rebuilds.
   * Prompt: "Act as a Developer Tools Engineer. Implement a cross-platform FileWatcher class in C++ for AriaBuild. The class should run on a separate thread and monitor the project's source directories for modify, create, or delete events. Upon detecting a change, it should trigger a callback to the BuildScheduler to re-evaluate the Dependency Graph. Use inotify for Linux, FSEvents for macOS, and ReadDirectoryChangesW for Windows. Provide the header file and the main event loop implementation."
