Task 3.1: Generate compile_commands.json
* Context: AriaLS needs build data.1
* Issue: Lack of IDE intelligence for project dependencies.
* Fix Prompt:"Implement a CompilationDatabaseWriter class. During the graph traversal in BuildScheduler, record every compilation action. Serialize this list into a JSON array of objects {'directory': '...', 'command': '...', 'file': '...'}. Write this to compile_commands.json in the project root on every build."
