Implement Compiler Dependency Generation Flags
Context: Fixes the "Comptime" blind spot and implicit dependency issues.
Priority: High
Components: src/main.cpp (Compiler Driver)
Prompt:
"You are a compiler engineer working on the Aria driver (src/main.cpp). Implement dependency tracking flags similar to GCC.
Add CLI flags: -M (generate makefile-style deps) and -MF <file> (output file).
Integrate a DependencyTracker singleton. Hook into Lexer::tokenize (to catch use imports) and Runtime::embed_file (to catch comptime reads).
In main, after compilation, serialize the tracked paths to the -MF file if -M is set.
Format: output.o: source.aria dep1.aria dep2.json...
Provide the C++ code modification for the compiler driver."
