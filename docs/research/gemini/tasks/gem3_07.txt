6. Performance: Monomorphization Caching
Gap: Generics lack a caching strategy, leading to redundant recompilation.1
Dependency: Required for scalable build times.
* Step 7: Design the Monomorphization Cache Subsystem.
   * Prompt: "Act as a Compiler Optimization Expert. Design the C++ architecture for a MonomorphizationCache within AriaBuild. The system needs to: 1. Compute a hash of the generic function body + the concrete type arguments (e.g., identity + int8). 2. Check a global cache directory (.aria/cache) for an existing compiled bitcode file matching this hash. 3. If missing, trigger the compiler to generate the specialization. 4. If present, reuse the artifact. Provide the class definition and the hashing algorithm strategy."
