Task 1.2: Implement clean Lifecycle Target
* Context: No way to remove artifacts.1
* Issue: Build directory pollution leads to globbing errors and stale link inputs.
* Fix Prompt:"Extend BuildScheduler to support a clean operation. Implement a clean_target(Target* t) function. This function should resolve the output path of the target and delete the file using std::filesystem::remove. It should also remove the associated entry from the .aria_build_state file. Expose this via the CLI as aria_make clean."
