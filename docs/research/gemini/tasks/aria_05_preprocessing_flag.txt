Preprocessing-Only Flag (-E) Support

PRIORITY: LOW
STATUS: Not Found in Research
SOURCE: Verification analysis (all chunks)

PROBLEM:
No flag to output preprocessed source (macro-expanded, imports resolved) without compilation. Useful for debugging macro issues and understanding module resolution.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. CLI flag:
   - aria_make -E <target> (preprocess only, no compile)
   - Output to stdout or file

2. Compiler integration:
   - Pass -E to ariac (if supported)
   - Halt after preprocessing phase
   - Preserve comments or strip based on flag variant

3. Use cases:
   - Debug macro expansion
   - Inspect module import resolution
   - Generate documentation from processed source

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS:
- [ ] Add -E flag parsing to CLI
- [ ] Check if ariac supports preprocessing-only mode
- [ ] If not, implement in ariac compiler pipeline
- [ ] Add output redirection (stdout vs file)
- [ ] Update ToolchainOrchestrator to handle -E mode
- [ ] Document flag in user guide

FILES TO MODIFY:
- src/cli/main.cpp (flag parsing)
- src/build/toolchain.cpp (pass -E to ariac)
- docs/info/plan/60_TOOLING_INTEGRATION.md (document flag)

RESEARCH STATUS:
NOT FOUND in any of the 35 research files. May not have been considered during initial design.

DECISION NEEDED:
- Is this a build system feature or compiler feature?
- Should aria_make support it, or is it ariac's responsibility?
- What does ariac currently output in preprocessing stage?

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (if approved):
- aria_make -E main.aria outputs preprocessed source
- Comments preserved or stripped based on flag variant
- Works with glob patterns (preprocess multiple files)
- Integration with IDE for "expand macro" feature
