Globbing Exclusion Logic
Context: Prevents infinite recursion into build/ or .git/.
Priority: Medium
Components: src/glob/glob_engine.cpp
Prompt:
"You are a C++ algorithm specialist. Update the GlobEngine in src/glob/glob_engine.cpp to support exclusions.
Modify GlobEngine constructor to accept vector<string> exclusions (e.g., build/, .git/).
In recursive_directory_iterator loop:
Check entry.path() against exclusion patterns.
If a directory matches, call it.disable_recursion_pending() to prune the tree efficiently.
Ensure platform-agnostic matching (handle / vs \).
Provide the optimized C++17 implementation."
