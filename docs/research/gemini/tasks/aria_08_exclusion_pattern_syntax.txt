Enhanced Exclusion Pattern Syntax

PRIORITY: LOW
STATUS: Basic exclusions work, advanced syntax missing
SOURCE: Verification analysis (all chunks)

PROBLEM:
Exclusion patterns in aria.json limited to simple strings. No support for negation (!pattern), complex wildcards, or directory-specific exclusions.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Negation patterns:
   - exclude: ["*.o", "!important.o"]
   - Include exceptions to exclusion rules

2. Directory-only matching:
   - exclude: ["build/"] (directories only)
   - Distinguish from files named "build"

3. Rooted vs floating patterns:
   - exclude: ["/vendor"] (only root vendor/)
   - exclude: ["vendor"] (any vendor/ directory)

4. Character classes:
   - exclude: ["test[0-9].aria"]
   - exclude: ["[abc]*.tmp"]

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS:
- [ ] Extend FastMatcher to support negation logic
- [ ] Add directory-only flag to exclusion rules
- [ ] Implement rooted pattern detection (leading /)
- [ ] Add character class support to glob parser
- [ ] Update documentation with pattern examples
- [ ] Add validation for exclusion pattern syntax

FILES TO MODIFY:
- src/glob/fast_matcher.cpp (pattern matching)
- src/glob/glob_engine.cpp (negation logic)
- src/parse/abc_parser.cpp (validate patterns)
- docs/info/plan/20_FILE_DISCOVERY.md (document syntax)

RELATED:
Complements aria_03 (.gitignore integration) which already implements some of these patterns for git files.

DEFERRED RATIONALE:
Basic exclusions work. Advanced patterns nice-to-have for complex projects. Can be added incrementally based on user requests.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (if implemented):
- exclude: ["*.tmp", "!keep.tmp"] includes keep.tmp
- exclude: ["build/"] skips directories only
- exclude: ["/node_modules"] skips only root node_modules
- Syntax validated at parse time with helpful errors
