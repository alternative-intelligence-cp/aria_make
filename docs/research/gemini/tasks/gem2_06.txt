Cycle Detection with Path Reconstruction
Context: Upgrades the cycle detector to provide actionable error messages.
Priority: Medium
Components: src/graph/dependency_graph.cpp
Prompt:
"You are a Graph Theory specialist. Implement the CycleDetector class in src/graph/dependency_graph.cpp.
Implement find_cycle(nodes) using a recursive DFS with Tri-Color Marking (White/Gray/Black).
Maintain a path_stack. When a Gray node is encountered (back-edge), strictly identify the cycle.
Implement reconstruct_path(): Slice the stack from the first occurrence of the recurring node to the top.
Return vector<string> containing the names of the targets in the cycle loop.
Provide the algorithm implementation."
