* Step 1: Implement Process Class and Pipe Abstraction.
   * Prompt: "Act as a C++ Systems Engineer. Implement a cross-platform Process class for the AriaBuild system. This class must wrap fork/execvp on Linux/macOS and CreateProcess on Windows. It requires methods to spawn a child process, wait for its completion, and most importantly, capture its stdout and stderr output via anonymous pipes into std::string buffers. Ensure the pipe reading is handled in a way that prevents deadlocks (e.g., using select, poll, or separate threads for stream consumption). Provide the header include/runtime/process.h and implementation src/runtime/process.cpp."
