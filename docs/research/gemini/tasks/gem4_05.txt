Task 2.2: Native Binary Linking Strategy
* Context: Reliance on lli interpreter.1
* Issue: Cannot ship standalone binaries.
* Fix Prompt:"Refactor ToolchainOrchestrator to support a dist mode. Instead of emitting .ll, invoke llc to compile IR to object files (.o). Then, detect the host linker (ld, link.exe) and invoke it to link object files into a native executable. Add a linker_flags field to the Target schema to support linking against system libraries (e.g., -lm, -lpthread)."
