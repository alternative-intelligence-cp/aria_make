compile_commands.json Generator
Context: Enables LSP support for the build tool.
Priority: Low (Tooling)
Components: src/build/compile_db.cpp
Prompt:
"You are a tools engineer. Implement CompilationDatabase generation in src/build/compile_db.cpp.
Define a class CompileDBWriter.
After the graph is resolved, iterate all targets.
For each source file in a target, create a JSON entry:
directory: Absolute path to project root.
file: Absolute path to source file.
command: The full compiler command string (as generated by ToolchainOrchestrator).
Serialize the array to compile_commands.json in the root.
Provide the C++ implementation using nlohmann/json or manual string formatting."
